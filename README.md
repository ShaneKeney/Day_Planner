# Day Planner App
Day Planner website for current day task planning

## Synopsis

Plan for your day using the allotted time blocks corresponding to typical
business workday (9AM - 5PM).  After inputting info into the appropriate block be sure
to save using the side button with the lock icon.  This will save the inputted tasks for
that block into local storage and will re-populate even when page is refreshed.  The following colors of the blocks correspond accordingly:
- Gray: Past current time block.  Tasks overdue if not completed already.
- Red: Within current hour.  Finish tasks in this block quickly.
- Green: Remaining hour blocks for the day.  You still have time to complete tasks.

## Features
* Current date displayed in header.
* Input tasks into organized time blocks.
* Save tasks into local storage for data consistency between refreshes.
* Color coded blocks for quick recognization (color code shown above).
